# Ravish

This will be a text-based dungeon crawler made in C++.
It will contain horror elements through the enemy types, descriptions, and lore.
Gameplay will be done through a grid to describe which room the player is currently in, I will use a linked list to direct the player's location
to the next room and will use classes for weapons, enemies, and playable characters. derived classes/children for each type of character, enemy, or weapon.
I plan 1 level initially with ten floors.
